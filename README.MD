# FnO GREL Functions

This library provides a standalone library for the [GREL]() functions in JAVA.
It also serves as a 'best-practice' example of how to implement your own FnO function implementation in JAVA.

## Installation

`mvn install`

## Best practices

### Use JAVA Classes, not primites

So `Integer` instead of `int`, etc.

> The Function Handler for the moment only handles Classes, not primitives.
